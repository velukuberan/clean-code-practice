# Clean Code Practice

Welcome to the learning hub for my clean code journey. This repository serves as a sandbox where I apply software engineering principles to a simple Library Management System. The goal is to focus on writing maintainable, testable code while exploring SOLID and other best practices.

## Why this project?

- **Experimentation** – Try out design ideas without the overhead of a large production codebase.
- **SOLID in Action** – Apply the Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov, Interface Segregation and Dependency Inversion principles.
- **Documentation Driven** – Record decisions and lessons learned through Markdown files.
- **Testing Culture** – Write unit tests early to reinforce good habits.

## What to expect

The codebase starts small and evolves through deliberate refactoring. Each commit aims to demonstrate clean architecture techniques, from separation of concerns to dependency injection. The `/docs` directory contains additional guides and notes collected along the way. See the [overview](overview.md) page for a more detailed description of the project goals.

I hope these notes help you (and future me) understand how thoughtful structure can keep even a simple project understandable and adaptable.
